My intitial thoughts are to use the html doc from the 'getting started with APIs' lesson and parse them into an app using React.

To give more details, I also sneed to pull in another non-google api/library. Would love to use wikipedia since we actually donate there regularly.

Then, I need to set up a Service Worker. Hoping the code from my restaurant reviews project will suffice with minor tweaking.
